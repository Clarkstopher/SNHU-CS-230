SNHU Operating Platforms CS 230

Here I will briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. I will discuss who the client was and the type of software requested.

The social media company Chat Away wants to develop a mobile platform version of their website, in an effort to reach more customers. They have requested that the app be exicutable on multiple platforms such as android and apple. Budget and timeline remain a high priority within the project.

Here I will discuss what I did particularly well in developing this documentation.

I believe I did well in my communication within the program with clear and concise comments.

Here I will discuss what about the process of working through a design document I found helpful when developing the code.

Some amount of discovery about a project is always helpful. ultimately the layout of the design document made it easy to break down the project and get a good pont to start. 

Here I will discuss if I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, what it would be and how I would accomplish it. 

I would focus more on the directions of the assignments/project layout and not fall behind. I fell behind in the class and it made it very dificult to catch up. I would take my time when reading the directions and I would try and find a way to stay on topic. 

Here I will discuss How I interpreted the user’s needs and implemented them into my software design and why it is so important to consider the user’s needs when designing.

The user is the reason you are developing something. When considering the users needs, the user feels values or listened to making them a repeat customer.
